Dear Dr. Churnside,

We are pleased to submit our revised manuscript {\em Multi sky-view 3D
  aerosol distribution recovery}, (195261).  We have addressed all the
requests made by the reviewers. The changes made to the manuscript are
detailed in the following pages. We thank the reviewers for their
helpful comments and hope that the paper in its current form satisfies
your requirements.

We look forward to hearing from you,\\

\vspace{0.2cm} Sincerely,

\vspace{0.6cm}
Amit Aides and Yoav Schechner\\

{\Large Changes Following the Comments by the Reviewers}\\

We would like to thank the reviewers for their general approval. In
the following we describe the changes made to the manuscript following
their remarks. Each reviewer's comment is summarized (colored in
blue), followed by our reply.

% REVIEWER I
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\noindent \underline {\bf Reviewer 1}

We appreciate the reviewer's comment. We address it below.

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textcolor{blue}{ ``The paper can be divided in two parts, one
    for computing single scattering, the other for multiple
    scattering. While the first part can be treated by a simple
    inverse transformation sampling as presented by the authors, the
    second part should have a different more complex inversion. For
    this reason I think that larger errors arise in multiple
    scattering. I feel the authors should dedicate some time to review
    this second part, that is more realistic."}

  {
    The reviewer raises a good point. Inverting the radiation transfer
    in the presence of multiple-scattering is the ``Holy Grail''
    of RT researchers. As far as we know there are no methods to
    solve this problem in the general case of non-homogeneous 3D
    atmosphere. Solutions are known only for a limited set of 
    situations.
    
    In this article we describe a novel data acquisition system
    and suggest a method to recover the 3D atmosphere based on
    the single-scattering approximation. Following the reviewer's
    suggestion we checked the limitations of the approximation
    by testing it in situations prone to high order of scatterings.
    Figures~5(b), 9(d) and 10(c) shows the results of applying
    out algorithm in a scene with dense aerosols distribution.
    Section~8 further discusses this experiment.
  }

\end{enumerate}

% REVIEWER II
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\noindent \underline {\bf Reviewer 2}

Reviewer 2 sees the paper as novel, highly relevant and well written.
The reviewer suggests that the paper is well worth publishing and
recommends accepting the paper after a minor revision.  We thank the
reviewer for his general approval. Below we address his/her comments:

\begin{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item \textcolor{blue}{``I donâ€™t understand Eq 9. If $F(u) =
    1-\exp(-u)$ how is $\nicefrac{1}{F} = -\ln(1-u)$?''}

  {The notation $F^{-1}$ refers to the inverse function
   of function $F$ and not to $\nicefrac{1}{F}$.}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item \textcolor{blue}{ ``Maybe define $\mu$ and voxel''}

  {We thank the reviewer for turning our attention to this.
   We replaced $\mu$ in Eq.~5 with its definition,
   $\cos \Phi^{\rm scatter})$. We revised the definition
   of the term ``voxel'', at the beginning of Sec.~4.}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item \textcolor{blue}{ ``How do you predefine the voxels
    vertically?''}

  {
    We now explain our vertical division of the atmosphere at the
    beginning of Sec.~5.
  }

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item \textcolor{blue}{ ``The result of the example (sec. 8) could be
    a little more precise in the sense that non-specialists get a
    clear idea of how your method works and which aerosol properties
    hinder or favor retrieval.''}

  {
    We appreciate the reviewer's comment. The issue raised by the
    reviewer is now discussed in Sec.~8. We also added Table~1 and
    Figs.~9 and 10, which show results of varying different properties
    of the aerosols and their distribution.
  }

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item \textcolor{blue}{ ``How many cameras in which distance do you
    need to obtain feasible results for the case of Sec. 5?''}

  {Following this comment, we tested  repeated the reconstruction
   simulations many times, each time varying the distance between
   cameras. The results are described in Sec.~8 and Fig.~8.}
