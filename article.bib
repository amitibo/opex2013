  abstract = {This paper presents a novel generalization of the optical flow equation
	to the case of refraction, and it describes a method for recovering
	the refractive structure of an object from a video sequence acquired
	as the background behind the refracting object moves. By structure
	here we mean a representation of how the object warps and attenuates
	(or amplifies) the light passing through it. We distinguish between
	the cases when the background motion is known and unknown. We show
	that when the motion is unknown, the refractive structure can only
	be estimated up to a six-parameter family of solutions without additional
	sources of information. Methods for solving for the refractive structure
	are described in both cases. The performance of the algorithm is
	demonstrated on real data, and results of applying the estimated
	refractive structure to the task of environment matting and compositing
	are presented.},

	are imaged by a lenslet array onto contiguous areas in a large-format
	camera. Low-layer turbulence causes an overall shift of the fringe

	internal deformations in the pattern. Parallel Fourier analysis permits
	separation of the atmospheric layers. Two mirrors, one conjugate
	to a ground layer and the other conjugate to a single high-altitude
	layer, are shown to widen the field of view significantly compared
	with existing methods.},

  abstract = {This paper shows that if the off-beam idle detectors in the detection
	ring of a fourth-generation x-ray computed tomography (CT) system
	are used to measure the scattered radiation, it is numerically feasible
	to reconstruct electron-density images to supplement the conventional
	attenuation-coefficient images of transmitted radiation. It is also
	shown that by combining these two images, composition changes can
	be detected with the aid of an effective-atomic-number indicator.
	The required image-reconstruction algorithms are developed and tested
	against Monte Carlo simulated measurements, for a variety of phantom
	configurations. In spite of the relatively poor statistical quality
	of scattering measurements, it is demonstrated that electron-density
	images of reasonable quality can be obtained. In addition, it is
	shown that composition discrimination is possible for materials of
	effective atomic number greater than five, in the photon energy range
	of a typical medical x-ray CT system operating at 102 kVp. The obtained
	supplementary electron-density and composition images can be useful
	in radiotherapy planning and for studying tumour histology, as well
	as in industrial and security applications where identification of
	materials based on density and composition is important.},

	degree of linear polarization (DOLP) with an uncertainty of less
	than 0.5\% in multiple spectral bands, at moderately high spatial
	resolution, over a wide field of view, and for the duration of a
	multiyear mission. To achieve this, the tandem PEMs are operated

	reflective imaging system. Operating the PEMs at slightly different
	resonant frequencies generates a beat signal that modulates the polarized
	component of the incident light at a much lower heterodyne frequency.
	The Stokes parameter ratioq=Q/I is obtained from measurements acquired
	from each pixel during a single frame, providing insensitivity to
	pixel responsivity drift and minimizing polarization artifacts that
	conventionally arise when this quantity is derived from differences
	in the signals from separate detectors. Similarly,u=U/I is obtained

	specific location within the object volume. The selected light paths
	still contain some global scattering contributions, though. Descattering
	based on high frequency illumination serves the same purpose. It
	removes the global component from observed light paths. We demonstrate
	that confocal imaging and descattering are orthogonal and propose
	a novel descattering protocol that analyzes the light transport in
	a neighborhood of light transport paths. In combination with confocal
	imaging, our descattering method achieves optical sectioning in translucent
	media with higher contrast and better resolution.},

	haze-free images contain some pixels whose intensity is very low
	in at least one color channel. Using this prior with the haze imaging
	model, we can directly estimate the thickness of the haze and recover
	a high quality haze-free image. Results on a variety of hazy images

  abstract = {In the last few years, several new algorithms based on graph cuts
	have been developed to solve energy minimization problems in computer
	vision. Each of these techniques constructs a graph such that the
	minimum cut on the graph also minimizes the energy. Yet, because
	these graph constructions are complex and highly specific to a particular
	energy function, graph cuts have seen limited application to date.
	In this paper, we give a characterization of the energy functions
	that can be minimized by graph cuts. Our results are restricted to
	functions of binary variables. However, our work generalizes many
	previous constructions and is easily applicable to vision problems
	that involve large numbers of labels, such as stereo, motion, image
	restoration, and scene reconstruction. We give a precise characterization
	of what energy functions can be minimized using graph cuts, among
	the energy functions that can be written as a sum of terms containing
	three or fewer binary variables. We also provide a general-purpose
	construction to minimize such an energy function. Finally, we give
	a necessary condition for any energy function of binary variables
	to be minimized by graph cuts. Researchers who are considering the
	use of graph cuts to optimize a particular energy function can use
	our results to determine if this is possible and then follow our
	construction to create the appropriate graph. A software implementation
	is freely available.},

	product of spatial and angular resolution in these light fields,
	we can nevertheless produce useful perspective views and focal stacks
	from them. Since microscopes are inherently orthographic devices,
	perspective views represent a new way to look at microscopic specimens.
	The ability to create focal stacks from a single photograph allows
	moving or light-sensitive specimens to be recorded. Applying 3D deconvolution
	to these focal stacks, we can produce a set of cross sections, which
	can be visualized using volume rendering. In this paper, we demonstrate
	a prototype light field microscope (LFM), analyze its optical performance,
	and show perspective views, focal stacks, and reconstructed volumes
	for a variety of biological specimens. We also show that synthetic
	focusing followed by 3D deconvolution is equivalent to applying limited-angle
	tomography directly to the 4D light field. CR Categories: I.4.1 Image

	the Sea of Azov, which are typical case II waters, i.e., turbid and
	productive. Our objective was to test the potential of satellite
	remote sensing as a tool for near-real-time monitoring of chl- a
	distribution in these water bodies. We tested the performance of
	a recently developed three-band model, and its special case, a two-band
	model, which use the reflectance at red and near-infrared wavelengths
	for the retrieval of chl- a concentration. The higher spatial resolution
	and the availability of a spectral band at around 708 nm with the
	MERIS data offered great promise for these models. We compared results
	from several different atmospheric correction procedures available
	for MODIS and MERIS data. No one particular procedure was consistently
	and systematically better than the rest. Nevertheless, even in the
	absence of a perfect atmospheric correction procedure, both the three-band
	and the two-band models showed promising results when compared with
	in situ chl- a measurements. The challenges and limitations involved
	in satellite remote monitoring of the chl- a distribution in turbid
	productive waters are discussed.},

	vision methods that account for physical processes occurring during
	image formation. Nevertheless, such recovery is prone to noise amplification
	in pixels corresponding to distant objects, where the medium transmittance
	is low. We present an adaptive filtering approach that counters the
	above problems: while significantly improving visibility relative
	to raw images, it inhibits noise amplification. Essentially, the
	recovery formulation is regularized, where the regularization adapts
	to the spatially varying medium transmittance. Thus, this regularization
	does not blur close objects. We demonstrate the approach in atmospheric
	and underwater experiments, based on an automatic method for determining
	the medium transmittance.},

	usually the natural illuminating light scattered by atmospheric particles

	remove the haze effects, except in restricted situations. Our method,
	however, stems from physics-based analysis that works under a wide
	range of atmospheric and viewing conditions, even if the polarization
	is low. The approach does not rely on specific scattering models
	such as Rayleigh scattering and does not rely on the knowledge of
	illumination directions. It can be used with as few as two images
	taken through a polarizer at different orientations. As a byproduct,
	the method yields a range map of the scene, which enables scene rendering
	as if imaged from different viewpoints. It also yields information
	about the atmospheric particles. We present experimental results
	of complete dehazing of outdoor scenes, in far-from-ideal conditions
	for polarization filtering. We obtain a great improvement of scene
	contrast and correction of color.},

	to scattering of light by participating media such as fog, mist and
	haze. While a number of sophisticated approaches based on Monte Carlo
	and finite element simulation have been developed, these approaches
	are computationally very expensive. In the context of rendering,
	the most common real-time methods are essentially simple variants
	of the OpenGL fog model. While easy to use and specify, the OpenGL
	fog model excludes many important qualitative effects like glows
	around light sources, the effect of volumetric scattering on the
	appearance of surfaces such as the diffusing of glossy highlights
	and the appearance of objects under complex lighting such as environment
	maps. In this project, we have developed a new physically based model
	for single scattering that captures these effects while maintaining
	the real-time performance and the ease-of-use of the OpenGL fog model.
	Our model is based on an explicit analytic integration of the single
	scattering light transport equations for an isotropic point light
	source in a homogeneous participating medium. We have implemented
	the model in modern programmable graphics hardware using a few small
	numerical lookup tables stored as texture maps. Our model can also
	be easily adapted to generate the appearances of materials with arbitrary
	BRDFs, environment map lighting and pre-computed radiance transfer
	methods, in the presence of participating media.},

  publisher = {IEEE},
  abstract = {Bad weather, such as fog and haze, can significantly degrade the visibility
	of a scene. Optically, this is due to the substantial presence of
	particles in the atmosphere that absorb and scatter light. In computer
	vision, the absorption and scattering processes are commonly modeled
	by a linear combination of the direct attenuation and the airlight.
	Based on this model, a few methods have been proposed, and most of
	them require multiple input images of a scene, which have either
	different degrees of polarization or different atmospheric conditions.
	This requirement is the main drawback of these methods, since in
	many situations, it is difficult to be fulfilled. To resolve the
	problem, we introduce an automated method that only requires a single
	input image. This method is based on two basic observations: first,
	images with enhanced visibility (or clear-day images) have more contrast
	than images plagued by bad weather; second, airlight whose variation
	mainly depends on the distance of objects to the viewer, tends to
	be smooth. Relying on these two observations, we develop a cost function
	in the framework of Markov random fields, which can be efficiently
	optimized by various techniques, such as graph-cuts or belief propagation.
	The method does not require the geometrical information of the input
	image, and is applicable for both color and gray images.},

	imaging geometries. The phantoms, the imaging geometries, and the
	noise were chosen to simulate the conditions encountered in typical

	The multiplicative algebraic reconstruction technique algorithm gave
	the best results overall; the algebraic reconstruction technique
	gave the best results for very smooth objects or very noisy (20-dB
	signal-to-noise ratio) data. My implementations of both of these

	its extent, and its smoothness. The smoothness of the reconstruction
	is enforced through the use of an appropriate object model (by use
	of cubic B-spline basis functions and a number of object coefficients
	appropriate to the object being reconstructed). The average reconstruction
	error was 1.7\% of the maximum phantom value with the multiplicative
	algebraic reconstruction technique of a phantom with moderate-to-steep
	gradients by use of data from five viewing angles with a 30-dB signal-to-noise

  abstract = {Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) aims at recovering three-dimensional
	images of absorption and scattering parameters inside diffusive body
	based on small number of transmission measurements at the boundary
	of the body. This image reconstruction problem is known to be an
	ill-posed inverse problem, which requires use of prior information
	for successful reconstruction. We present a shape based method for
	DOT, where we assume a priori that the unknown body consist of disjoint
	subdomains with different optical properties. We utilize spherical
	harmonics expansion to parameterize the reconstruction problem with
	respect to the subdomain boundaries, and introduce a finite element
	(FEM) based algorithm that uses a novel 3D mesh subdivision technique
	to describe the mapping from spherical harmonics coefficients to
	the 3D absorption and scattering distributions inside a unstructured
	volumetric FEM mesh. We evaluate the shape based method by reconstructing
	experimental DOT data, from a cylindrical phantom with one inclusion
	with high absorption and one with high scattering. The reconstruction
	was monitored, and we found a 87\% reduction in the Hausdorff measure
	between targets and reconstructed inclusions, 96\% success in recovering
	the location of the centers of the inclusions and 87\% success in
	average in the recovery for the volumes.},
